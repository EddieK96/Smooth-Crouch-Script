# Smooth-Crouch-Script
I've noticed that current crouch scripts out there are somewhat clunky so i decided to make full use of the games' native animation system to create **smooth** transitions and make it less intrusive control-wise.  

[Demo: v0.9](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHlevz6Th2U)  

**Features:**  
* Ability to shoot while crouched.  
* Modified running speed while crouched.  
* The stealth animation is now used for aiming down sights.  
* Jumping or falling resets stance.   

**Controls:**  * Press Ctrl to toggle crouch.   

**Known Issues:**  
* Requires testing.  
* *May* or may not override certain clipsets.  
* Does not work with AI wanted level as the game overrides "Action Mode" for character animations.   

**To-do list:**  
* Make aspects of the mod configurable.  
* Convert code to event functions to reduce cpu-load.
